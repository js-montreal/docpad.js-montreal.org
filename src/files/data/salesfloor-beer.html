<h2>Beer + Pizza</h2>

<p>
  At <a href="http://salesfloor.net/">SalesFloor</a> We believe that a retail sales associate is more than just a nametag and a uniform. They are product experts and influencers for their customers and for the people in their trusted social networks and communities. In todayâ€™s omni-channel world, retail chains have the opportunity to leverage their biggest asset, their people, as a new direct sales channel.

  <strong>Come early!</strong> Beer and pizza being served starting at <strong>6PM</strong>, and meetup starts at <strong>7PM</strong>.
